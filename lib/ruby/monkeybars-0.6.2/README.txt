Monkeybars 0.6.2
http://www.monkeybars.org

== DESCRIPTION:
  
Monkeybars is a library that enables you to interface (via JRuby) with and take advantage of Swing without writing any Java directly.  Using any editor you like, you create Java GUI elements and Monkeybars takes care of registering event listeners, receiving and handling events, updating your view from a model, etc. Monkeybars makes very few assumptions about your model or the structure of the code in your Java forms so it can be integrated into existing projects with a minimum of hassle.
